"""Crucible versioning primitives (`crucible-vN`) — spec §5.

A discovery is reproducible only if its run manifest pins all four coupled layers: the SYSTEM
version (this constant + a matching git tag), the GATES hash, the DATA snapshot hash, and the RNG
seeds. This module owns the first two.

`crucible-v1.0` == the system exactly as it existed at the baseline git tag (signals funnel T0–T5 +
C3 evolve + C1 combiner + TSMOM/rates-carry base sleeves + WQ101 DSL). `crucible-v2.0` is the first
version to fold in a *semantic* gate change — the ``delta_p05_min`` fragility-veto repair
(median ∧ frac-positive; expert-review Test B) — so the frozen gates hash canonizes the FIXED gate,
never the known-broken one (spec §5, "gate-repair-before-freeze").

`crucible-v2.1` is the P1a **MINOR** bump: the CR-9 data-representation path (Panel feature slots +
grammar terminal registry + ``candidate_type`` on SignalSpec + overlay/conditioner eval through
``combination_fitness``). It ADDS terminals + a candidate type + an eval path that EXTENDS the funnel
without changing any existing verdict. CRITICAL: this bump must NOT be conflated with a gates change —
NO ``FitnessConfig`` default and NO gates YAML byte changed, so the frozen ``crucible-v2.0`` gates_hash
(the moat) is IDENTICAL. Do not re-hash the gates for a MINOR system bump.

`crucible-v2.2` is the P1b **MINOR** bump: the free-data acquisition subsystem
(``crucible/data/`` — ``DataConnector`` + FRED/ALFRED + CFTC COT + the non-OHLCV quality gate with
the as-of-join reconstruction tripwire + the Panel-feature-slot bridge). It ADDS connectors and a
PIT-safe data path; it changes NO verdict semantics and NO gate byte, so the ``crucible-v2.0``
gates_hash is again IDENTICAL.

`crucible-v2.3` is the P2 **MINOR** bump: the agentic hypothesis loop (``crucible/agentic/`` — the
Hypothesis Author that sees ONLY ``ledger_agent_view`` (CR-1), pre-registers overlay/CS specs (CR-2),
the injectable ``Proposer`` seam + deterministic ``LibrarySeedProposer``, the ``DiscoveryCard`` schema,
and the manual ``run_hypothesis_loop`` orchestrator). It ADDS an agent capability that FEEDS the
UNCHANGED C3 ``evolve`` mine + T0–T5 funnel; it changes NO verdict semantics and NO gate byte, so the
``crucible-v2.0`` gates_hash is again IDENTICAL. The harness still caps at PROMISING and every
DiscoveryCard is ``incubation_status=PENDING_P4`` (the CR-8 lockbox is P4).

`crucible-v2.4` is the P3 **MINOR** bump: the continuous orchestrator (``crucible/orchestrator/`` —
the nightly ``run_orchestrator_tick`` loop, the ``substrate_dirty`` eligibility gate (§10.1), the
per-substrate LORD++ online-FDR budget (§6.1, CR-3), the per-tick ``TickBudget`` cost cap (CR-7), and
the advisory GPUHub burst router). It ADDS a scheduling/accounting layer AROUND the UNCHANGED P2 mine
+ T0–T5 funnel — it never touches Stage 4 or a gate value (CR-1). It changes NO verdict semantics and
NO gate byte, so the ``crucible-v2.0`` gates_hash is again IDENTICAL. The online-FDR wealth is a
CROSS-run governance budget (it replaces the fatal global file-drawer N, Fable finding #1); it does
not modify the within-run DSR/N_eff. Everything still caps at PROMISING; the CR-8 forward-incubation
lockbox that makes a card human-gate-eligible is P4.

`crucible-v2.5` is the P4 **MINOR** bump: the CR-8 forward-incubation lockbox (``crucible/lockbox/`` —
the durable enrollment store + the forward marginal-contribution measurement on bars STRICTLY after a
survivor's ``proposal_ts`` + the fixed-horizon verdict state machine). It ADDS a forward gate
DOWNSTREAM of the funnel: a PROMISING survivor is enrolled and judged on data that did not exist when
its hypothesis was written, and its card becomes eligible for the human Tier-2 gate ONLY once its
lockbox track is CLEARED. It changes NO within-run verdict semantics and NO funnel gate byte — the
incubation criterion lives in its OWN file (``configs/crucible_lockbox.gates.yaml``) precisely so the
frozen ``crucible-v2.0`` funnel gates_hash (the moat) stays IDENTICAL. Still nothing promotes past a
human + Tier-2 (CLAUDE.md); the lockbox only decides *eligibility* for that gate.

`crucible-v2.6` is the P5 **MINOR** bump: breadth + governance polish + the reproduce payoff (spec §8
P5 row). It ADDS (a) three free-data connectors — Stooq (market), GDELT (sentiment), SEC EDGAR
(fundamentals, the cleanest true-PIT source: filing-acceptance ``filed`` timestamp as release) — plus
the ``DataScout`` Stage-1 ACQUIRE driver (survey → quality gate → as-of-join tripwire → reviewable
report; registration a separate reviewed step); (b) the ``crucible/governance/`` layer that turns a
lockbox-CLEARED survivor into an operator notification + a Tier-2 handoff packet (verbatim verdict +
forward evidence + the EXACT human-run ``deep_strategy_audit`` command), recorded once; and (c)
``crucible reproduce`` — verify a past run re-derives its verdicts + pins bit-identically. Every piece
sits AROUND the funnel: no connector, scout, notifier, handoff, or reproduce step reads a gate value or
scores a candidate (CR-1), and NO gate byte changes — so the frozen ``crucible-v2.0`` funnel gates_hash
is again IDENTICAL. The governance layer NEVER promotes or runs the audit; capital still requires a
human-initiated Tier-2 (CLAUDE.md). This completes the spec's phased roadmap (P0–P5).

Semantic bump rules (spec §5): MAJOR = changes the statistical verdict semantics; MINOR = new data
connectors / agent capabilities / DSL operators that extend without changing existing verdicts;
PATCH = bug fixes / reporting / non-semantic.
